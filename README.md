# Sample-Portfolio-website

I am here just trying web-development technologies.

This is a sample porfolio website. Technologies used in this website are HTML, CSS.

[ Making use of HTML tags as title, link, section, division, paragraphs, headers, footers, anchor; similarly css styles/properties for classes, headers, buttons and others, as font-family, font-size, color, line-height, width, float, padding, margin, border-radius, text-decoration, etc.]
